## Overview

The `components/` directory houses 14 reusable UI components built with React. These components follow modern React patterns and are designed for reusability across the application.

## Component Architecture

### React Component Structure
Based on the file extensions (.tsx, .jsx), components are built using:
- **TypeScript React Components (.tsx)** - Type-safe React components
- **JavaScript React Components (.jsx)** - Standard React components

### Component Design Principles
- **Reusability** - Components designed for use across multiple contexts
- **Composability** - Components that can be combined to create complex UIs
- **Type Safety** - TypeScript components with proper prop typing
- **Separation of Concerns** - UI logic separated from business logic

## File Organization

### Component Categories

#### UI Components
- Basic UI elements (buttons, inputs, cards)
- Layout components (headers, footers, containers)
- Navigation components (menus, breadcrumbs)

#### Composite Components
- Complex UI patterns combining multiple elements
- Feature-specific component compositions
- Page-level component assemblies

#### Utility Components
- Higher-order components (HOCs)
- Render prop components
- Context providers and consumers

## Component Types

### Functional Components
Modern React functional components using hooks for state and lifecycle management.

### TypeScript Components
Type-safe components with proper prop interfaces and type definitions.

### Styled Components
Components with integrated styling solutions.

## Cross-References

### Dependencies
- **[Hooks (`hooks/`)](./hooks.md)** - Custom React hooks used within components
- **[Types (`types/`)](./types.md)** - TypeScript interfaces for component props
- **[Services (`services/`)](./services.md)** - Business services called from components

### Consumers
- **[Source Code (`src/`)](./src.md)** - Core application code that uses these components
- **[Application (`app/`)](./app.md)** - Application layer that imports and renders components

## Related Modules

| Module | Relationship | Description |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| [`hooks/`](./hooks.md) | Dependency | Custom hooks used for component logic |
| [`types/`](./types.md) | Dependency | Type definitions for component props |
| [`src/`](./src.md) | Consumer | Source code that imports and uses components |
| [`app/`](./app.md) | Consumer | Application layer that renders components |
| [`lib/`](./lib.md) | Dependency | Utility functions used in components |
| [`services/`](./services.md) | Dependency | Services for data fetching and business logic |

## Component Patterns

### Common Component Patterns
1. **Presentational Components** - Pure UI components without business logic
2. **Container Components** - Components that manage state and data
3. **Compound Components** - Components that work together as a system
4. **Render Props** - Components that share logic through render functions
5. **Higher-Order Components** - Components that enhance other components

### Props and State Management
- Props interfaces defined in types/ directory
- State management using React hooks
- Context for shared state between components

## Development Guidelines

### Component Best Practices
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Use TypeScript for prop validation and type safety
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Write components with accessibility in mind

### File Naming Conventions
- PascalCase for component files
- Descriptive names that indicate component purpose
- Consistent file extensions (.tsx for TypeScript, .jsx for JavaScript)

### Import Patterns
Components typically import from:
- `../hooks/` for custom React hooks
- `../types/` for TypeScript interfaces
- `../lib/` for utility functions
- `../services/` for data and business logic

## Testing Components

Components are tested using files in:
- **[Testing (`tests/`, `__tests__/`)](./testing.md)** - Component unit tests and integration tests
