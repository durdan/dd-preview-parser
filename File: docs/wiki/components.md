## Overview

The `components/` directory houses 14 reusable React components that serve as the foundation for the application's user interface. These components follow React best practices and are designed for reusability across different parts of the application.

## Component Architecture

### Design Principles
- **Reusability**: Components can be used across multiple pages/features
- **Composability**: Components can be combined to create complex UIs
- **Props Interface**: Clear and typed props for component configuration
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliant components
- **Performance**: Optimized rendering and minimal re-renders
